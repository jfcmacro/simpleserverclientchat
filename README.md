# A Simple Client-Server Chat

This is an implementation of a simple client-server chat.
This is chat is the source code for an coding story.
The coding story uses the chat to show how to manages the input/ouput
between a client and server. That interaction is showed with different
strategies:

* Java Threads
* Non-blocking IO
* Asynchronous IO
* Multiplexed IO

Each strategy is identified with a different tag (or branch) on the life time
of the project register by git.
